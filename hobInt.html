        <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
        <p>
          Everyone has things they like to do or would like to do in their free
          time. These can range from just playing games to horse riding. In my
          opinion, having a hobby is pertinent to one's mental health and
          psychological stability, as it can be considered a net to fall back on
          whenever you feel too stressed. A way of releasing that stress is very
          important.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I cannot think of anything else to say here, let us count down the
          top 5 interests of mine.
        </p>

        <ol reversed>
          <li><span class="head">Coding</span></li>
          <figure id="feature">
            <img src="Images/Code.png" alt="Code" width="300" height="200" />
            <figcaption>
              A bit of C++ code that I wrote a long time ago
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          Starting off the list, we have coding. Mainly coding for fun, or just
          easy questions in general. Why would one enjoy it, you might ask. To
          answer that question, I shall redirect you to the
          <a href="highSchool.html">High School chapter.</a>
          <br />
          <br />

          As an example, recently we have been assigned an assignment in
          Fundamentals. Though unnecessary, I wrote a 1967-line code to submit
          that you can view
          <a href="Fundamentals.txt">here.</a>
          <br />
          <br />

          Was there a point in coding such a ridiculously long project? No. Do I
          get more points for it? Hopefully. But that is the point of a hobby:
          It is for fun.
          <br />
          <br />
          Finally, though it is fun, I cannot just code the entire day without
          feeling tired or worn out, so coding is superseded by the things
          below.
          <br />
          <br />
          <li><span class="head">Movies</span></li>
          <figure id="feature">
            <img src="Images/film.jpg" alt="A film" width="150" height="200" />
            <figcaption>One of the recent films that I enjoyed.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          I have a special rule for movies. If it is in English or Vietnamese, I
          let it run like normal, probably because I understand what they are
          saying.
          <br />
          <br />
          If it is in any other language though, I will fast forward it to 2x
          speed, saving a lot of time. Quite a couple of my friends disapprove
          of this method, but I enjoy it immensely.
          <br />
          <br />
          I would not say I have a favorite, since after I watched something I
          rarely come back to it, but in general, I prefer Japanese animation
          over all others. Maybe it is because they can portray things as dark
          as they are without having to worry about censorship.
          <br />
          <br />
          The longest consecutive period of time that I have spent watching
          movies are probably about 5 hours, which pales in comparison to the
          entries below.
          <br />
          <br />
          <li><span class="head">Reading</span></li>
          <figure id="feature">
            <img src="Images/books.jpg" alt="Books" width="200" height="150" />
            <figcaption>A picture of books I found on Google.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          I started reading at a very young age, both English and Vietnamese, so
          I can read quite quickly. This allows me to tear through books much
          quicker than normal people would.
          <br />
          <br />
          My favorite genre would be psychological thriller or psychological
          crime-solving, if that is what it is called. Their complicated yet
          exceptionally crafted stories have engraved themselves on my brain.
          <br />
          <br />
          Once I pick up a book that interests me, I only stop for food or when
          I am forced to sleep. I believe the longest time I spent reading was 7
          hours continuously, delaying lunch back then. Some of the longer books
          that I have read stretches into days of reading, though not
          continuously of course.
          <br />
          <br />
          <li><span class="head">Music</span></li>
          <figure id="feature">
            <img
              src="Images/codePandorum.png"
              alt="Code Pandorum's logo"
              width="200"
              height="150"
            />
            <figcaption>
              The logo belongs to one of my favorite artists.

          Music can be considered an integral part of my life, used when I code,
          read books or play games. The only days I do not listen to music would
          be the days that I was sick.
          <br />
          <br />
          My taste in music is unique, with my main genre being Deathstep. A
          mixture of Dubstep and Death metal, it is most likely the most brutal
          "music" you can find anywhere, although I do listen to other genres as
          well.
          <br />
          <br />
          That is about it about music: An integral part of my life, not much to
          say.
          <br />
          <br />
          <li><span class="head">Games</span></li>
          Perhaps it is a surprise, perhaps not. I play a couple of games, but I
          do dedicate towards them.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whenever I find a game that I really like, I spend a lot of time
          researching the game: Character, lore, meta, ... Aside from the games
          I play, and I watch a lot more.
          <br />
          <br />
          I would not say I have a favorite genre in games, very inconsistent
          across the board. I can control my playing so that it does not affect
          my day-to-day life at all, but that was not the case when I was 13. If
          you are interested, you can read the
          <a href="highSchool.html">High School chapter.</a>
        </ol>
        These five hobbies shaped my life as I know it, and have transformed me
        into what I am today. Love them or hate them, I am quite thankful for
        them.
