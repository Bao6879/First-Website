          The table below displays a short summary of my life. Unfortunately,
          since I cannot remember things too clearly from years ago, the dates
          and events might be slightly inaccurate. The table only lists events
          that I would consider major in my life. The cyan-colored rows are sub
          rows that are events that occured during the period of time of an
          event above.

              During this time, my family's economic situation was not optimal,
              so I lived in the countryside with my grandparents. This
              positively affected life later on, mainly relationship with people
              from the town.

              My mother placed a high priority on my English skills. As such, I
              started at a much younger age than my peers. This benefited my
              life massively later on, as you shall see.

            <td>
              As all Asians do, I started learning Math at a reasonably young
              age. This gave me a slight edge over foreign competitors in this
              part.

            <td>
              I went to a pretty good primary school near my house. The
              education system in Vietnam is different from Ireland, where
              Primary school stretches from 6 years old to 10 or 11. I was quite
              good at Math and English starting 7 years old, regularly competing
              in district-wide competitions. It was the golden age, as my mother
              would call it.

              The competition was in English. Sadly, with my weird studying
              method (intuitively instead of by the book), I only got a bronze
              prize.

            <td>
              Secondary school in Vietnam stretches from 11 years old to 14 or
              15. I went to a very average school, and my academic abilities
              tanked as a result of finding no competition. However, I would say
              it is the most fun out of all compulsory education.

            <td>
              This was a lengthy period when I was severely addicted to video
              games. I will not go into too much detail here, but it was quite
              devastating to my academic and physical abilities.

            <td>
              The high school entrance exam is similar to the leaving cert in
              Ireland. However, what I started preparing for is the specialized
              tests for gifted schools, orders of magnitudes more difficult than
              the normal version. I went to a lot of different teachers to learn
              1 subject: Math.

              A decimating rejection snapped me out of the dangerous mental
              state I was in, and I started to focus on studying again, harder
              than ever before. This played a key role in my behavior later on,
              even now.

              4 years of secondary school culminated in this event. I

              with the specialized one?

              HSGS stands for High School for Gifted Students. With slight bias,
              I would say it is the best High school (academically) in Hanoi.
              Objectively speaking, we dominate the international stage in
              Vietnam, and we are very proud of that. Most of the knowledge I
              have now comes from here.

            <td>
              A very fun and informative class, led by the most brilliant
              Informatics teacher HSGS has ever seen, I can attribute 99% of my
              IT knowledge to this class. Its purpose was to select students to
              participate in the National Olympiad. I failed this test, somewhat
              intentionally, placing 16th out of 50. Having guaranteed a seat in
              one of the best IT Universities in Vietnam, my eyes drifted to
              open seas.

              The first step for my portfolio is a good SAT score. 1350 in the
              first practice test told me I needed to prepare though, and the
              test took place in May. My strong English background helped a lot
              in the preparation, allowing me to focus on the trickiest parts of
              the English language: Advanced grammar and vocabulary.

              me firmly in the top 3 of the school at the time. Having conquered
              the SAT, I moved on to the TOEFL.

              what would have happened if I chose Japan instead, but the

              shudder whenever I remember it. This was also where most of the

              I fell ill just the day before, leading me to enter the
              examination with 3 hours of sleep. Was it that? Was it due to
              insufficient preparations? The 1560 prompted self-doubt in my
              mind. Thankfully, the reason I did not fall into depression and
              despair would be friends and games.
