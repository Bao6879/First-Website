        <h1>Quotes that I like</h1>
        <p>
          Although I know some people live by the quotes that they like, I
          cannot say the same to myself. I try to adhere to them as much as I
          can, but emotional instability or other sudden events can still
          disrupt it. Still, if you were my friend, you would see me quoting
          these quite a bit.
          <br />
          <br />
          Without further ado, these are 7 quotes that I like in no particular
          order:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="head">Not much in life really matters:</span></li>
          <blockquote>What is life, but death pending?</blockquote>
          <p class="author">- Vampyr -</p>
          <p class="normal">
            My personal interpretation of the quote is that the bad things in
            life do not matter at all, since death is waiting at the end anyway,
            so there is not much of a point feeling too down about something.
            <br />
            <br />
            Obviously, you can make the argument that the quote means the other
            thing as well, where good things do not matter either, but I have
            remedied it with the quotes below.
            <br />
            <br />
            This is only a short part of the full quote:
            <a href="fullQuote.html" target="_blank">here.</a>
            I like this quote not only because it sounds very cool, but also
            because it enables me to think more positively about life.
          </p>
          <li><span class="head">Never give up</span></li>
          <blockquote>It's not over till it's over.</blockquote>
          <p class="author">Unknown</p>
          <p class="normal">
            A classic quote that I am not sure of the origin, it is as simple as
            it sounds. Another variation of this could be "As long as you're
            breathing, it's winnable", which is a classic Vietnamese quote,
            especially game. It is also one of the quotes I cannot live by 100%,
            as when you really just lost, there is not much you can do, unless
            you are god.
          </p>
          <li><span class="head">Adaptability</span></li>
          <blockquote>Improvise, adapt, overcome.</blockquote>
          <p class="author">Thomas Highway from Heartbreak Ridge</p>
          <p class="normal">
            This quote enables me to continue changing, adapting to the
            surroundings when neccessary, mainly in new environment, e.g:
            Studying abroad. Also quite catchy, if I would say so myself.
          </p>
          <li><span class="head">Nothing is impossible</span></li>
          <blockquote>
            Nothing is hard <br />
            Fear only the weak willed <br />
            Moving mountains and filling oceans <br />
            Where there's a will, there's a way
          </blockquote>
          <p class="author">Uncle Ho</p>
          <p class="normal">
            This is a quote back in the war days of Vietnam, spoken by the
            leader and liberator of Vietnam himself, uncle Ho. Unfortunately, my
            translation cannot do it justice.
            <br />
            <br />
            The quote is quite simple in nature, similar to never give up and
            nothing is impossible. I mainly quote this line in despair filled
            scenarios, e.g: Blackjack, Poker.
          </p>
          <li>
            <span class="head">There is no such thing as an early victory</span>
          </li>
          <blockquote>Never celebrate too early</blockquote>
          <p class="author">Unknown</p>
          <p class="normal">
            In contrast to the positive ones above, here we have a quote telling
            us to exercise caution. This quote is invaluable in the games that I
            have played, mainly racing and rhythm games, where one mistake could
            cost the entire run. I also apply it to projects that I code as
            well, finishing it before hosting a celebration to avoid
            procrastination.
          </p>
          <li><span class="head">Motivation</span></li>
          <blockquote>Right. Let's get going then.</blockquote>
          <p class="author">Me :)</p>
          <p class="normal">
            This one was created and used mainly by me, similar to a mantra,
            forcing me to go do whatever I have left behind. It is a simple
            sentence, but I use it a lot, especially chasing deadlines.
          </p>
          <li><span class="head">Be cautious</span></li>
          <blockquote>Never underestimate anything.</blockquote>
          <p class="author">Unknown</p>
          <p class="normal">
            Another simple one to understand, yet it is vital in judging
            opponents in PvP games and tasks at hand. Following this quote, I
            started on my project early and was able to figure out a critical
            error within it that made me scrap the entire project. If I had left
            it till later, it would be catastrophic.
