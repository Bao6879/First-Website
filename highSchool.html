        Let us start the tale at the end of the Dark Ages, when every electronic
        device was out of sight and locked with passwords that I did not know. I
        was still not over games though, playing secretly at school. I will omit
        the extreme cases of my misgivings, just understand that it was extreme.
        Now, when I look back on it, I do not remember what I played back then,
        emphasizing how pointless it was.
        <br />
        <br />
        As seen in <a href="history.html">history</a>, the thing that snapped me
        out of it was a destructive rejection. With it, I went back to studying
        properly and got past the brutal entrance exam to
        <a href="https://hsgs.edu.vn/" target="_blank">HSGS</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        After entering the school, my main focus was getting into the
        pre-Olympiad classes for Informatics. This meant I needed to get a
        decent understanding of basic C++. We had to do problems on a website
        called "Codefun", which is a massive problemset database with about 450
        problems to do. If you did more than 300 problems, you're in. After a
        month, I and about 70 more entered the pre-Olympiad class.
        <br />
        <br />
        The class focused completely on Competitive Programming, which meant we
        did not need to study any other subject, which is a needed advantage, as
        the problems we would face in the class were very difficult. We learned
        about different algorithms and data structures and implemented them into
        problems. Every week or so, there would be a small test, known as LAH
        (in Vietnamese, so I can't translate it), just to see where we were in
        the class and how we were getting on.
        <br />

          />

        One of the first events saw the entire class solving problems on Codefun
        using Python. It was supposed to help us learn a bit of Python for later
        on. Unfortunately, or fortunately, I completed the task in 3 days, so it
        did not register too much with me. I remember seeing my pupils grow
        slightly red.
        <br />
        <br />
        Aside from Competitive Programming, we also did a bit of English,
        translating a book on Blockchain from English to Vietnamese. I did 3 out
        of the 25 chapters and fixed a lot of the Latex code that we were
        working with. It was very fun.
        <br />
        <br />
        Back to Competitive Programming, my proudest achievement would probably
        be the Northern Informatics Olympiad (NIO). It was an Olympiad hosted
        for 15 and 16 years old students for those in the Northern part of
        Vietnam. We did 3 LAH back-to-back to determine those who would be
        going, with the better scores going into the 16-year-old division. Out
        of the 7 that were chosen, I got the highest score out of all the 15
        years old in the 15-year-old division. I remember being very shocked
        about it and gloating for a while afterward.
        <br />

        />
        While being in the pre-Olympiad class, I was also in the school
        ambassador group. This meant I met and interacted with a lot of
        delegations from different universities. This drastically improved my
        English and expanded my horizons past Vietnamese education. The picture
        on the side is a picture of the team meeting the Japanese.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the end of the class, algorithms and data structures were becoming so
        ridiculously complicated that I struggled to even understand the
        concept, much less start to code them. It was then that I decided I did
        not want to spend my next year just banging my head against the screen
        trying to solve these problems. So I reviewed the stuff that I know well
        enough to guarantee being in the top 35. See, the top 35 would get
        instant admission to one of the best IT universities in Hanoi. After
        getting top 16, I switched over to focusing on English.
        <br />
        <br />
        After the SAT and TOEFL, I eventually decided to set my sights on SETU,
        being in an English-speaking EU country, while being more affordable
        than Dublin or Cork. All that was left was to prepare the necessary
        documents.
